# OpticalTachometerOledDisplay
Arduino-based Optical Tachometer with OLED display. It uses an IR LED and IR Photodiode pair to detect a piece of reflective aluminum tape on a spindle to calculate and display the RPM
Here's a complete Instructable on building the Sensor and connecting it to the Arduino

### Prerequisites
Your favorite Arduino IDE.

You'll also need the Adafruit Adafruit_SSD1306 and the Adafruit-GFX-Library. Both libraries are free and the links are listed below.

## Acknowledgments

* The code is entirely original.  
* Thanks to my high school Trigonometry teacher.  Who knew I would use it to draw dials when I grew up.
* Thanks to Robert C. Martin, author of "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship".  His method of refactoring and using (lots of) short clearly named functions, changed my coding style from tons of comments to none.  Chapter 4: Comments "Comments do not make up for bad code"
